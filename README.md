# Sensors-actuators-training-kit
Arduino-based sensors and actuators training kit project

Type: Group Project (highlighting personal contributions)

Description: This project simulates and implements a training kit using Arduino microcontrollers to control various sensors and actuators. 
Components include Arduiono Uno/Nano, buzzers, relays, PIR sensor, ultrasonic sensor, DHT11 temperature/humidity sensor,fan, motor driver, potentiometer, bread boards, connecting leads and so on. The project demonstrates embedded systems concepts and circuit control.

## My Contributions
- Connected and tested Arduino Uno/Nano with sensors and actuators  
- Simulated the system in Wokwi to verify logic and behavior  
- Developed control code using Arduino IDE  
- Created project documentation and technical report  
- Coordinated and organized workflow with the team  

## Tools & Technologies
- Arduino Uno & Nano  
- Buzzers and Relays  
- PIR Sensor, Ultrasonic Sensor, DHT11 Module  
- Fan, Motor Driver, Potentiometer  
- Wokwi Circuit Simulator  
- Arduino IDE (C/C++ programming)  

## Learning Outcomes
- Hands-on experience with sensors and actuators  
- Circuit simulation and testing in a virtual environment  
- Technical documentation and reporting skills  
- Understanding the fundamentals of embedded systems and IoT  

## Future Work
- Implement AI/ML-based control for automation of the circuits  
- Expand the kit for additional sensors or robotic modules
- Implement IoT by the use of ESP32 instead of Arduino for remote monitoring and control of components
